Spatial-point pattern analysis of typhoid fever 
This repository is for the work I have done for my MSc in Statistics dissertation. There are a number of 
files on this site:
1 - STRATAA analysis script file - This file merges all the scripts used in this analysis
2 - Exploratory analysis - Contains the non-spatial and spatial exploratory analysis for the report
3 - PCA and linear geostatistical model - Comprises work on Principal Components Analysis (PCA) which was 
used to derive a Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) score from the households that were enumerated for the WASH study.
The derived PCA was then used as an outcome in the linear geostatistical model. The goal of this was to predict the WASH 
score to unsampled areas in Ndirande
4 - Statistical modelling - comprises analyses using the inhomogeneous Poisson process model and 
log-Gaussian Cox process (LGCP) models
5 - Other work done. I attempted to also fit the spatial LGCP model and spatio-temporal LGCP model using Bayesian estimation 
in the LGCP package. These results were not reported in my write up. The work is contained in the LGCP models file.
